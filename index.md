I am interested in understanding the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity. My research capitalizes on plant-pollinator interactions to evaluate the interplay of ecology and evolution through the process of pollination. I address questions that integrate pollination ecology, flower evolution, plant mating systems, and conservation biology. I combine landscape-scale observational field surveys, classic and cutting edge field experiments, a variety of techniques of molecular biology, and a breadth of methods in statistical analysis.

Currently, I am a researcher in the Department of Biology at Lund University. I am part of the [Speciation, Adaptation and Coevolution Research Environment][2] and work most closely with [Øystein H. Opedal][1]. My research provides a mechanistic understanding of the role of pollinators as agents that drive the diversification of flowering plants.

I completed my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Toronto. I worked in the [Spatial Ecology and Landscape Genetics Lab][3] led by [Helene H. Wagner][4]. My PhD research focused on understanding the ecological consequences of hummingbird pollination for plant mating systems.
